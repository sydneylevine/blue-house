You should do this because this is when what they did is most apt to be at the forefront of their mind. You also send a message to other would-be policy breakers that you mean business by doing so.,"Under the Employment at Will Doctrine, employers may fire employees for just about any reason, including company policy violation. As a result, an employee breach of the implied contract in the form of policy violation, might constitute good cause for the employer to fire the employee. ","It does not matter if you broke the item intentionally or negligently or ""with gross negligence"". An employer can seek to be reimbursed, ask you to pay for the item, fire you or otherwise discipline you, but employers who help themselves to employee wages are thieves.","In some situations, an employer is required to follow their own policies and apply them consistently, or be subject to legal liability.

949,7/13/21 13:02,R_24HMExfYXgUdOwK,A time in which I intentionally broke a company rule is when I left a catered event I was scheduled to work at to go assist another team with the event they were catering.,"Our event was easier than expected, and the amount of staff we had at it was unnecessary to handle the amount of clientele we had.  We had served everything and were basically sitting around until it was time to start breaking down everything.  Instead of staying to help my team breakdown everything, and haul it back to our shop where we'd do any necessary cleaning, I informed them that i was going to leave it to them as a colleague informed me that they were getting hammered at another event.  I felt at that moment, I would be of better use helping up their team and that my team could afford to lose me for the evening.  The other team was overwhelmed and the event they were on was far busier than expected, so I felt it would be better for me to be there, helping them get through their event, than sit around waiting for my event to end.","The consequences for my team were that it would take them a bit extra time to break down and they would likely be at our shop longer cleaning up, but on the flip side of it, it also meant that I'd be able to help the team who was overwhelmed, get through their event more smoothly, get them packed up quicker, and get their cleaning at the shop done a bit quicker so they wouldn't be stuck at work all night.  My team still would get out of a work at a reasonable hour without me assisting them, making me feel as if they'd be ok with me jumping ship to help another team out who was very much desperate for help.","My manager wished I had informed him of my decision to go help another team out, leaving the team I was on in doing so, but when I explained the situation to them as a whole, they thought I did the right thing and thanked me for doing so, as they had a lot of catered events scheduled for the night and knew some of them might be understaffed.
